						 <p>Female orgasm (n.) During sexual intercourse, an unfakeable indicator that the male is capable of giving women intense pleasure.</p> <p>Many scientists have examined the female orgasm and yet found no link between the frequency of orgasms in women, and their sexual success. They have thus concluded that the female orgasm is an accident of evolution. This ignores that there are at least five distinct pathways to orgasm in the female.</p> <p>There is, of course, a strong link between female orgasms and sexual success in <em>the male</em>. In other words, a man capable of giving such pleasure to his female partners will have more success than a man who is not, other attributes such as wealth, power, and looks being equal.</p> <p>The female orgasm is a mechanism for sexual selection <em>of the male</em>, and has evolved over the last millions of years as a barrier that males must climb over to convince their partners that they are special. Their speciality is no more or less than their ability to climb over this barrier, backed up by the time and energy that takes.</p> <p>Over years, the female genome has pushed this barrier higher and higher, a gentle arms race between the genders. We can postulate that males have gotten gentler and more patient since we split off from our ape cousins.</p> <p>Difficulty with orgasm is, in the female, not a sexual disorder, but a sign of a healthy barrier that excludes all but the highest quality males. Indeed, women who have orgasms easily with any partner can be considered abnormal in this respect.</p> <p>The evolution of the female orgasm as a sexual selection mechanism can be trivially proven by correlating the ability in males to climb that wall with frequency and diversity of their sexual partners. Second, to eliminate causation in the other sense by asking women to express a preference. Third, to show that this talent is inherited.</p> <p>The female orgasm can also be considered as part of the &quot;black market&quot; in sexuality. Women are overtly attracted to males for their power and ability as providers. Orgasms play no part in this. Indeed, a woman might prefer a husband who cannot climb that wall, since her garden is not the only one around. However, when a women seeks a lover on the side, especially if she intends (as a significant proportion of women do) to have children with one man while attributing them to another, this talent becomes a paramount selector.</p> <p>Again, trivially proven by interviewing women: <em>if you were married, would you choose a lover on the basis of their power and wealth, or their ability to give you frequent, deep orgasms.</em></p> <p>Social regulation that forbids sex before marriage can be seen as a tactic by which men collude to prevent women pre-selecting them on this basis.</p> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=99&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1485775377" alt="pieterh" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=99)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" >pieterh</a></span></p>

						 <p>Diary (n.) A type of virtual <a href="http://wiki.hintjens.com/wiki:bitchtorrent">Bitchtorrent</a> peer invented by a frustrated teenage girl.</p> <p>While many people consider diaries to be a normal part of teenager life, it is a provable fact that these were unknown in past times, say 10,000 years ago. Rather than a quaint attempt at self-documentation, diaries may better be seen as a sign of trouble in the life of a young growing woman. Specifically, a female who has access to sufficient Bitchtorrent peers will maintain a healthy store of up-to-date torrents, and high upload ratios, giving her a good social status and high self-esteem. However, an isolated young woman, lacking in sisters, female cousins, and close female friends, will create an imaginary Bitchtorrent peer with whom to create a persistent bond. &quot;Dear diary&#8230;&quot;</p> <p>While there is no direct harm in considering a diary to be a better listener than, for example, one's parents, the indirect damage can be significant and long term. First of all, diary writers will suffer from low self-esteem, having no human peers to help in self-evaluation. This low self-esteem will translate into poor choice of friends, subjects of study, husband, and eventually, interior decorations.</p> <p>Second, failure to practice real Bitchtorrent at a young age makes females somewhat incompetent at navigating the real world, when they finally leave home. A common coping mechanism is male mimicry, in which a female learns <a href="http://wiki.hintjens.com/wiki:woofing">Woofing</a>, seeks employment in a pack structure (that is, a traditional business or bureaucratic setting), and attempts to find self-esteem by competing with males. This strategy is generally guaranteed to fail, leaving the female at thirty with no partner (since family and work do not mix), and unable to get one (since men do not enjoy women who speak Woofing back to them).</p> <p>Incidentally, even females who do not keep a diary and who establish good Bitchtorrent networks while young, will find their share ratio falling if they invest significantly in male mimicry in a pack structure.</p> <p>Thirdly, since Bitchtorrent serves as the principle conduit for information about the world, women who do not build healthy Bitchtorrent networks will make errors of judgment based on inadequate information and wrong assumptions. Such as, &quot;I know he loves me, he told me so.&quot; To which a real Bitchtorrent peer would reply, &quot;Don't fool yourself, sister, he just wants you to sleep with him,&quot; and back that up with the relevant stories. The diary is thus the silent partner in the misery of many young and confused women.</p> <p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly from an overall socioeconomic perspective, the failure of a significant proportion of individual Bitchtoothing networks represents a systemic failure of an important aspect of social fabric. A society dominated by Woolfing speakers, lacking the balance that Bitchtorrent networks provide, will be efficient but will also be stupid, and commit ghastly mistakes on a massive scale.</p> <p>Luckily the 21st century discovered how to make Bitchtorrent work over the Internet, giving us Facebook and Myspace.</p> <p>Without technological assistance, women will establish persistent peering relationships only with a small number (half a dozen or so) high-value peers. Modern &quot;social networking&quot; software (this common label ignores the essentially gender-oriented nature of the scenario) lets women scale their network to hundreds of lower-value peers, which has been very bad for the diary business, but good for young women everywhere, as well as fun for many men who have found that such web sites let them speak fluent Bitchtorrent, with almost no effort.</p> <p>Having said all this, it remains a crime of theft (of information value, in the Bitchtorrent sense) for anyone to read another person's diary, unless the writer is a historical figure. Parents who find diaries in their daughters' drawers should under no circumstances read them. They should however take the time to establish a Bitchtorrent channel, starting with the offering of rich and valuable information. To the father who asked his pregnant teenage daughter, &quot;why did you not tell me you had a boyfriend?!&quot;, the girl may accurately answer, &quot;because you never told me anything intimate about yourself&quot;.</p> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=99&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1485775377" alt="pieterh" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=99)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" >pieterh</a></span></p>

						 <p>Woofing (n.) The canine command-and-control language that men use to self-organize. As in the common female complaint, &quot;he's Woofing, instead of listening to me&quot;.</p> <p>Woofing carries minimal information content and is mainly about the assertion of power. While volume matters, the loud woof of one dog is less significant than the low rumble from the leader of a large dog pack. Woofing is a simple language with only three principle concepts: &quot;do!&quot;, &quot;go!&quot;, and &quot;look!&quot;</p> <p>Male social status is entirely based on the size of the pack they can build through well-timed Woofing.</p> <p>One of the striking features of human society is the utter incompatibility between Bitchtorrent and Woofing. Females understand Woofing from a very young age, but find the language offensive and degrading except in the special case of dominant female speaking to male. Most men find women who speak Woofing to be intimidating.</p> <p>Many males can speak a trivial version of Bitchtorrent in emulation mode but find it strenous and pointless, unless there is sex within a certain period, the length of which depends on the female's attractiveness and availability. More typically, the female attempts to open a Bitchtorrent channel in order to establish a peering relationship with the male, and the male responds in Woofing, leaving both parties confused and unhappy, the male providing a flat zero bits per second transfer rate, and the female neither doing, going, nor looking.</p> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=99&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1485775377" alt="pieterh" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=99)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" >pieterh</a></span></p>

						 <p>Bitchtorrent (n.) The peer-to-peer protocol that women use to exchange information, more politely called &quot;<a href="http://wiki.hintjens.com/wiki:bluetoothing">bluetoothing</a>&quot;.</p> <p>Bitchtorrent allows two peers to trade torrents of information, based on mutual valuation of the quality of, and specific content of, torrents. The source of a torrent, its freshness, and its relevance are combined into a self-ranked score. The peer will then upload fragments of the torrent in exchange for fragments of another torrent of equally ranked score. A common honesty enforcement strategy is &quot;full box / empty box&quot;, in which each peer responds to a fragment they receive with a fragment they estimate to be of equal value.</p> <p>As a protocol, Bitchtorrent can be implemented in any human language, and Bitchtorrent implementations are compatible between all cultures, suggesting that the Bitchtorrent package is implemented automatically, at boot time.</p> <p>In general, female human brains (including those of many homosexual men) implement Bitchtorrent from the onset of puberty, or earlier, while male brains do not have Bitchtorrent capability. In contrast, all females understand <a href="http://wiki.hintjens.com/wiki:woofing">Woofing</a> from a very early age, and dominant females speak Woofing when talking to men.</p> <p>Bitchtorrent traffic acts as a <em>status indicator</em> in human society. That is, female social status is based on their Bitchtorrent upload ratio and the quality of their peer network, as well as on the size of the car their husband bought them.</p> <p>Bitchtorrent is a <em>competitive</em> protocol, meaning that peers gain more value as they learn to use the protocol better. Principally, peers learn to bluff up the value of the information they hold (&quot;it's a secret!&quot;), bluff down the value of that held by the other (&quot;oh, yes, I knew that&quot;), and rapidly detect cheats while avoiding the &quot;cheat&quot; label oneself. We can safely assume that this competitive aspect has driven the evolution of Bitchtorrent since the first female hominid explained to another where she had found those amazingly pretty stones, over a million years ago.</p> <p>Bitchtorrent is also a <em>persistent peering</em> protocol, meaning that once a peering relationship has been established, it continues indefinitely until explicitly broken by one of the parties through public pronouncement (&quot;I'm never speaking to her again!&quot;). When two peers are separated for a time, and then reconnect, they synchronize their torrents, a process that can take many hours, even days.</p> <p>Females thus build different Bitchtorrent networks depending on their age and the importance of the information they can share. From one to ten years, with close relatives including both parents, and for practice with any other females of close age. During the intensity of puberty, with sisters, and close friends. From adulthood, as skill and discrimination improves, with anyone.</p> <p>For several reasons, but mainly because they speak Woofing to their offspring, parents with a male brain (usually but not all nor only fathers) do not usually manage to peer properly with their female offspring. It can happen in the case of sole fathers who spend the time to learn fluent Bitchtorrent.</p> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=99&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1485775377" alt="pieterh" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=99)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" >pieterh</a></span></p>

						 <p>Burnout (n.) A post-traumatic stress disorder caused by excessive investment in an imbalanced project.</p> <p>Most individuals who undertake significant projects undergo burnout, though few would formalize their symptoms as such. The stages of burnout, from start to finish, are expressed by clear emotional states as follows:</p> <ol> <li><em>Naive enthusiasm</em>, in which the individual undertakes a project of heroic impossibility. This phase can last for a year or so.</li> <li><em>Brave optimism</em>, in which the individual works on the project, understaffed and undercompensated. This phase can last for a few months to several years depending on how successful the project is. Note that project success often just makes the burnout deeper.</li> <li><em>Cynical abandonment</em>, in which the individual suddenly and without warning abandons his project. At the least, the individual &quot;drops off the radar&quot; with no explanation. In the worse cases the individual tries actively to destroy the project so that no-one else can take it over.</li> <li><em>Active disinterest</em>, in which the very mention of the project raises urges to vomit and break things. This usually lasts about the same as the period of brave optimism.</li> <li><em>Cautious reawakening</em>, in which the individual tries to re-engage, hopefully with some new knowledge of wtf happened.</li> </ol> <p>Rules for avoiding burnout:</p> <ul> <li>Don't work alone on killer projects.</li> <li>Delegate so you are replaceable.</li> <li>Take breaks when you feel you need them, don't be a hero.</li> <li>Don't work with or for exploitative b*!*!*!ds.</li> </ul> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=99&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1485775377" alt="pieterh" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=99)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" >pieterh</a></span></p>

						 <p>Housing Market (n.) The only market where governments deliberately create inflation.</p> <p>This house believes that the best way to protect the core wealth of the middle classes is to severely restrict the housing market so that the construction of new houses is almost impossible.</p> <p>Yes, this means house prices will be high, that young couples won't be able to afford a new home, that the construction industry won't boom, that the mortgage industry will be slow and boring. It also means that cities won't see their hearts left to rot, that we won't see the green zones eaten up by new houses, that people will live concentrated in cities and use public transport rather than drive to and from work every day.</p> <p>It also means that house prices will be based on something real: scarcity. When a family invests in a house, paying their mortgage each month, and the state allows the construction of new houses, this deflates the value of existing houses. In effect, it is deliberate inflation, a form of wealth distribution that takes from the middle classes to give to the poor. It is notable that the construction of new houses in upper class residential areas is universally restricted.</p> <p>Countries that dramatically liberalise construction regulation tend to see a construction boom followed by a collapse in housing prices, followed by economic recession. A direct consequence of a liberal housing market is the widening of the gap between rich and poor, as tranches of the middle class are impoverished. Post-unification Germany would be a good example. So would California in 2007, followed by all countries that saw a housing boom: Australia, UK, Spain, etc.</p> <p>by <span class="printuser avatarhover"><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" ><img class="small" src="http://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=99&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1485775377" alt="pieterh" style="background-image:url(http://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=99)" /></a><a href="http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pieterh" >pieterh</a></span></p>

						 <p>Oil (n.) The remains of ancient bacteria, conveniently liquefied and converted to pure combustible hydrocarbons.</p> <p>Oil is of course the basis for modern <a href="http://wiki.hintjens.com/wiki:civilisation">civilisation</a>, and we finish it off, we might do well to reflect on the fate of many past civilizations that ran out of essential raw materials and then collapsed.</p> <p>Kübler-Ross wrote that the five stages of acceptance of a terminal disease are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Most of the western world still lives in denial, and will probably slip directly to depression. I don't have anything against a major collapse of civilization.
